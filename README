ctrlp-funky
============

This is a ctrlp.vim extension and it picks out functions currently being edited file without ctags.
It just searches function definition or equivalent of it, therefore some languages abstraction
aren't accurate because of hard to parse.
One of the advantages of this plugin is you needn't to generate tags file to jump to a function definition.
